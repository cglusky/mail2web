This is a development version of the Drupal 6 mail2web module

Based on my proposal here: http://drupal.org/node/351260

Please see main project page here http://drupal.org/project/mail2web

Due to $message now being passed as an object vice array this module depends on a Messaging version dated after Dec 25, 2008

There are several changes made to this module that have not been incorporated yet to the official version

1) Addition of message id to body of email to handle cases when email clients strip needed header info.
   See http://drupal.org/node/290214
2) Handles changes made by email clients to the to address.  
   E.g. example@example gets changed to "example"<example@example.com>
   See http://drupal.org/node/290214
3) Removes extra text insterted by some mail clients when replying to an email.
   E.g. "On 1 Jan example wrote"
   *Note that this is not applied as a filter as in the D5 version.  
    This version actually removes the text before it is saved.
4) If the marker from mail2web settings can not be found then the entire email will be used as the comment body.
   This allows for inline commenting, which was a feature request from user testing.
